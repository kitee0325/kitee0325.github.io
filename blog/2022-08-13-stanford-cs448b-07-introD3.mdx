This article contains my notes from Stanford's CS448B (Data Visualization) course, specifically focusing on the seventh lecture about introduction to D3. I'll discuss the importance of D3, the principles behind it, and explore various techniques for visualizing data, including the use of guides, expressiveness, effectiveness, support for comparison and pattern perception, grouping and sorting data, transforming data, reducing cognitive overhead, and consistency. I'll also cover various chart types, such as line charts, bar charts, stacked area charts, and others, providing examples and discussing their design considerations.

## Notes

### Forward Thinking

- Can D3 verify data and check errors, or should all the data wrangling occur before using it?
- I'm still really confused about the use of the enter, update, and exit data fields. Why would a programmer need to have access to data that has already exited?
- When would you recommend someone to use D3 over tools such as Tableau, particularly in a workplace / professional setting?
- For D3, did Mike Bostock and team have to choose between doing their PhD research and building out their project for general programmer consumption?
- It was mentioned that D3 is the standard in industry for making these dynamic and interactive visuals, but is that still the case with static visuals?
